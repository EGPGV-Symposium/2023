The Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) aims to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge on exploiting and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization. This area is of growing importance due to the widespread availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems. Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel, efficient parallel solutions.

EGPGV has two submission deadlines: early submission in December and regular submission typically in February. This offers authors the flexibility to choose between two separate submission deadlines. The early submission deadline also provides the opportunity of improving manuscripts and resubmitting them to the regular deadline in case they are not successful in the early review phase, resembling a major revision review process. An FAQ about the early submission process can be found at the bottom of this email. Please notice also that this year there are again abstract deadlines one week in advance to the paper deadlines.

EGPGV 2023 will take place on June 12, 2023, and be co-located with EuroVis 2023, held June 12-16, 2023, in Leipzig Germany.

The proceedings of EGPGV will be published in the Eurographics Proceedings Series and in the Eurographics Digital Library. Best papers from the EGPGV symposium will be invited to submit an extended journal version to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.

EGPGV seeks papers on graphics and visualization that involve any type of parallel computing, and/or focus on very large data sets. Papers on techniques, data structures, algorithms, systems, and applications are welcomed. Parallel computing is broadly defined, including high-performance computing and cloud environments, (multi-)GPU computing and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures, and shared and/or distributed memory architectures. Further, papers focused on processing very large data sets (either for visualization or graphics) are welcomed, even if they do not have a particular focus on parallelism.

Typical symposium topics include:

- Computationally and data-intensive rendering
- Scientific visualization (e.g., volume, flow, and tensor visualization)
- Information visualization and visual analytics
- In situ analytics and in situ visualization
- Out-of-core processing of large data sets for visualization or graphics
- Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics)
- Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
- Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation)
- Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence
- Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce
- Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization
- Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
- Large and high-resolution displays, virtual environments
- Scientific, engineering, and industrial applications
- Data analytics on large scientific data sets
- Machine learning as applied to parallel graphics, visualization and/or large data analytics

In general, appropriate topics for the symposium fall into one of four categories:

(1) parallel graphics,
(2) rendering of very large data sets,
(3) parallel visualization and analytics, and
(4) processing of large data sets for visualization or analytics.

For additional information regarding paper submission and publication, please contact the program chairs.

EGPGV again calls for Full Papers (8 to 10 pages) and Short Papers (up to 4 pages) in Eurographics format (+ 1 page of references). The EGPGV webpage will be updated soon with more details on submission.
