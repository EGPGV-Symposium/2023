{{< spoiler text="What happens if my paper is accepted in the early submission review cycle?" >}}
Your paper will have the exact same status as any paper accepted during the regular submission review cycle. It will appear in the proceedings and you will present your paper at EGPGV23.

{{< spoiler text="Who can benefit from the early submission process?" >}}
There are benefits whether the paper is accepted or not accepted. For accepted papers, the benefit is in getting acceptance earlier and having more time for, e.g., travel organization. For multiple minor revisions, major revisions, and rejected papers, the benefit is in effectively adding a revision cycle, i.e., getting feedback from the early submission and then submitting the revised paper to the regular submission deadline.

{{< spoiler text="If I do not submit to the early submission deadline, can I still submit to the regular submission deadline?" >}}
Yes, you can absolutely submit to only the regular submission deadline.

{{< spoiler text="What is the timeline for the regular submission deadline?" >}}
We are still in discussions with Eurographics with respect to camera-ready deadlines. Traditionally, EGPGV has a submission deadline of late February and a notification of early April. We expect the timeline for the regular submissions to match this traditional schedule.

{{< spoiler text="What paths can an early submission take?" >}}
<ul>
  <li>It might be accepted straightaway on January 24.</li>
  <li>It could be conditionally accepted on January 24, which would require a revision on February 7. This could result in an accept, another conditional accept, or a reject on February 14. In case of another conditional accept, the revision will be due at the regular submission deadline. In case of a reject, the work can be resubmitted as new at the regular submission deadline.</li>
  <li>It could receive a major revision decision on January 24, which would be due at the regular submission deadline.</li>
  <li>It could be rejected on January 24. In this case, the work can still be resubmitted as new at the regular submission deadline.</li>
